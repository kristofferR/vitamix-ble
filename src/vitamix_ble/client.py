"""Async :class:`VitamixClient` — a thin wrapper around :mod:`bleak`.

Replies carry no transaction id, so exchanges are correlated by
sequencing them: one outstanding request per connection, and any
notification that arrives while nothing is pending is dropped. After a
timeout the client reconnects before its next request, because the late
reply could otherwise be taken as that request's answer. The official app
also polls one request at a time; the device sends no unsolicited
notifications in normal operation.
